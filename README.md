# VariableFinder
fairly unintelligent and rushed PHP Based variable and function sniffer. Displays finding as a table, alongside its location. Will try its best to remove duplicates. 

## Setup
Just change the directory variable to the root folder of your PHP based program, and load the php file.
There is an option to show found folders. You can change this to TRUE or FALSE.

If you find any bugs, either figure it out yourself or contact me. :)
